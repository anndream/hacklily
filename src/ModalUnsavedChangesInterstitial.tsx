/**
 * This is the "Do you want to save your changes" modal you get when you load a song
 * while the current one has unsaved changes in the current song.
 *
 * Now, we could instead just redirect the user, since we do store the code for
 * ALL songs that are dirty in localStorage, but that may result in the user being
 * confused when she or he tries editing the song somewhere else and isn't sure where
 * the source went. Multiple sources of truth are bad in this case. So we leave this
 * feature only for the case when the tab is closed without saving. In no case will
 * the page change while leaving dirty state for the old song.
 *
 * This modal requests to be closed by calling one of the three callbacks.
